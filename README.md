# User-Level Threading Library

Lightweight, preemptive threading framework built in C for applications requiring fine-grained concurrency control and minimal kernel overhead. Features custom scheduler implementation with microsecond-precision timing and comprehensive synchronization primitives.

## Key Features

- **Preemptive Round-Robin Scheduling**: Signal-based time slicing with configurable quantum intervals for fair CPU distribution
- **Zero-Kernel Overhead**: Pure user-space implementation using POSIX ucontext for ultra-fast context switching
- **Thread Synchronization**: Full mutex implementation with atomic operations and deadlock-resistant blocking queues
- **Lightweight Architecture**: Minimal memory footprint with dynamic thread control block management
- **Signal-Safe Operations**: Robust interrupt handling with proper signal masking during critical sections
- **Automatic Resource Management**: Built-in cleanup mechanisms preventing memory leaks and zombie threads

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

**Thread Control Blocks (TCB)**
- Comprehensive thread state management (READY, SCHEDULED, FINISHED, TERMINATED)
- POSIX ucontext-based register and stack state preservation
- Efficient linked-list organization for O(1) queue operations

**Preemptive Scheduler**
- Configurable time quantum (default: 10ms) with SIGPROF-based interrupts
- Round-robin fairness algorithm ensuring starvation prevention
- Automatic thread lifecycle management with garbage collection

**Synchronization Framework**
- Mutex primitives with atomic test-and-set operations
- Thread-safe waiting queues using lock-free data structures
- Join semantics supporting value passing between threads

### Threading Model

```
Main Thread ──┐
              ├── Thread Pool ── Round-Robin Scheduler ── Context Manager
Worker Threads┘        │              │                       │
                   Mutex Queue    Timer Signals          Stack Management
```

- **Context Switching**: Sub-microsecond user-space transitions via ucontext
- **Memory Isolation**: Independent 16KB stacks per thread with overflow protection
- **Synchronization**: Lock-free algorithms where possible, mutexes for complex critical sections

## Technical Specifications

- **Language**: C (C99 standard) with POSIX extensions
- **Context Management**: POSIX ucontext (makecontext, swapcontext, getcontext)
- **Timing**: POSIX interval timers (setitimer) with SIGPROF signals  
- **Synchronization**: GCC atomic builtins (__sync_lock_test_and_set)
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation with automatic cleanup
- **Thread Limits**: Bounded only by available system memory

## Performance Characteristics

- **Context Switch Latency**: Sub-microsecond user-space transitions
- **Scheduling Overhead**: O(n) complexity with optimized linked-list traversal
- **Memory Efficiency**: 16KB stack per thread + minimal TCB overhead
- **Timing Precision**: Microsecond-granular quantum control
- **Scalability**: Linear performance degradation with thread count

## Implementation Highlights

- **Atomic Operations**: Lock-free mutex acquisition using GCC atomic primitives for maximum performance
- **Signal Safety**: Comprehensive signal masking during scheduler operations preventing race conditions
- **Memory Safety**: Automatic stack allocation/deallocation with proper cleanup on thread termination  
- **State Management**: Robust thread lifecycle tracking with proper joining and value return semantics
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of invalid operations and resource exhaustion scenarios

// Critical section
worker_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

// Wait for completion
void *result;
worker_join(thread_id, &result);

## API Reference

### Thread Management
- `worker_create()` - Spawn new thread with specified function and arguments
- `worker_yield()` - Voluntary CPU relinquishment for cooperative scheduling
- `worker_exit()` - Thread termination with return value propagation
- `worker_join()` - Blocking wait for thread completion with result retrieval

### Synchronization Primitives
- `worker_mutex_init()` - Initialize mutex with configurable attributes
- `worker_mutex_lock()` - Acquire exclusive access with automatic blocking
- `worker_mutex_unlock()` - Release mutex and wake waiting threads
- `worker_mutex_destroy()` - Cleanup mutex resources and validate state

## Code Quality Features
